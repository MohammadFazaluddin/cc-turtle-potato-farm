## Description
This script allows the turtle to fully automate your food resource, potato for instance or you can change it and farm any other vegetable of your choice. it will work just fine, change the name of the item and viola you have your own automated farm with turtles running all over it working hard for you.

## Why automate a farm with turtles?
Want to you actually autmoate your farm with robots and turtles then this is it.
In the world of minecraft you need food to survive. And to solve the world hunger you just need a single turtle that will work for you in return of nothing, only a single turtle, potato and some dirt. That is all you need to build this. plus if you are programmer like me you probably like to use this over other complex redstone automated or semi-automated farms. Why, because this is actual automation. let's go.

## Want to run it in your own world? do this.
- Make two rows of your planting dirt place a block at the end of both sides for turtle to show that this is the end of farm.

- Place the turtle in middle, facing the farming dirt. Fill in some coal and potatoes, for fuel and planting.

- Download the file from [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/JGEWJwGR) in the turtle using the command and run the file.

```bash
pastebin get JGEWJwGR automatefarm
```
- You have your automated farm up and running.
